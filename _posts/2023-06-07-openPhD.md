I am looking for 1-2 highly motivated Ph.D. students for Spring/Fall 2024 semesters (starting in January/September). The positions are in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo-Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
 
I encourage those with a passion for applying machine learning and deep learning to urban transportation and mobility data and utilizing advanced AI methods to solve transportation and mobility problems, to apply.
 
Areas of research interest, though not limited to, are:
-      Urban transportation and mobility data analytics
-      Spatiotemporal data modeling (forecasting, imputation)
-      Generative AI for transportation and mobility data
-      Modeling CAV, C-ITS using Reinforcement Learning
-      Other applications of machine learning and deep learning in the transportation domain
 
Preferred candidates should have strong quantitative and modeling skills, and excellent communication skills. They should be interested in using data-driven, AI methodologies for extensive data analysis and AI/deep learning model development. A strong background in mathematics, machine learning, and computer programming (Python, C++) is highly recommended.
 
If interested, please reach out to me via email at chois[at]umn.edu with the subject line: “Prospective PhD Student [Name]”. Please include a CV, a statement of research interests, and an academic transcript.
