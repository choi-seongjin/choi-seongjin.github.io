I am absolutely thrilled to share that I have accepted the offer to join the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities as an Assistant Professor, starting in January 2024!

As an Assistant Professor, I am eager to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field, mentor and inspire the next generation of engineers and leaders, and collaborate on multidisciplinary projects to make a lasting positive impact on our communities and the world.

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my mentors throughout my research career, Hwasoo Yeo, Lijun Sun, Jiwon Kim, and Nicolas Saunier.
Your encouragement, guidance, and belief in me have been invaluable, and I am deeply thankful. üôè

I can't wait to embark on this new chapter of my career in the vibrant and welcoming community of #UMN!!!
