I had a great time at the 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2024)!
I presented a paper from my postdoc works titled [Better Batch for Deep Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/zheng24a.html) along with Vincent Zheng and Professor Lijun Sun.
It was a great experience to see a lot of theoretical aspects of machine learning and modern AI! Can’t wait to think about new topics I can work on based on the experiences I had!
